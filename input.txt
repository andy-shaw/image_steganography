Below is my data gathered from twitter. Paste into an excel worksheet for proper viewing.
Data was gathered manually by copying the most recent (chronologically) post tagged with #GamerGate off twitter. Page was reloaded after every sample to take the most recent post. Only posts ignored were repetitive spam (same article posted over and over, I only sampled one or if the same user posted multiple times, I only sampled them once per day), non-English posts, and bot spam (such as a thunderclap or if six accounts all posted the same message at the same time).
This data does not include any pictures or account names. Names were not included specifically for ethical reasons.

The following methods were used in choosing categories:
Harassment is a tweet with the intent to intimidate, insult, or silence any individual or defined group. Intent was interpreted by looking at the conversation, the people/topics tagged, and the poster. Posting something insulting of a group or person in a conversation where reasonably it could be expected the person/group discussed would not see it, I did not deem harassment.
Attention seeking was any account self-promotion using the tag (Watch my video, read my article) or simply using the tag to bring attention to a non GamerGate related topic, such as nail care. I do not count Twitlongers as self-promotion, as I consider them more like a long tweet.
Trolling was any account which had a solid posting history of only posting things in an attempt to get attention or harass people. Looking at their history, if I saw posts covering semi-random topics and all of them derogatory (racism, sexism, gamergate, religions, etc), I would consider the account a troll.
Ethical tweets (or the on topic category) were any tweet that seemed to be advocating for ending, or pointing out, corrupt journalism practices. Even if the tweet was wrong, I simply interpreted their intent.
In the same category, as I consider it the second focus of gamergate, is tweets calling for ending harassment. Asking everyone to calm down and act peacefully, calling out specific people who are harassing others, or any general call to end harassment of gamers/ women in gaming.  As long as the tweet wasnt harassing someone while it was calling out for an end to harassment.
Morale tweets are any tweets that advocate for Gamer Gate or a person in Gamer Gate to not give up, to take a break and come back refreshed, to not lose hope, etc. World War two style propaganda posters are an example.
Other cover any tweets that do not fall into any other category. They can be things unrelated, or opinions on topics that simply arent debate, harassment, morale boosting, or about ethics/ending harassment. Things like I agree, seals are cute. #GamerGate to I think hes trying to rebuild his relationship with #GamerGate

Dear, #GamerGate. Before you return telling me to "do my research" and "educate myself" about GG, keep in mind I'm a PhD candidate...                                       17-Oct
@DarkMossGarden Anita isn't really part of #Gamergate's crosshair, but she is mostly a obstacle right now. Same with Mrs. Wu.                   1                   17-Oct

@marcoarment @Spacekatgal seriously? youve gotta know #Gamergate has nothing to do with this? #Gamergate is about female equality in gaming                 1       1           17-Oct
@Jonny_Wags It's hard to not dismiss opinions that amount to"youre literally supporting misogynist terrorism".I try but Im human. #GamerGate                    1                   17-Oct
@DarkMossGarden Yes, the disturbing threat. That was interesting. But the problem is that it has no link to #Gamergate. No hash tag.                    1                   17-Oct
Here's the breakdown. If you support #gamergate, you're either too young to see what it's really about, or you're a malicious misogynist.       1                               17-Oct

#GamerGate didn't start ~2 months ago. The frustration against game journos has been around for a lot longer, and only given a name then.                               1       17-Oct

presenting only one side of the story when there is clearly 2 is unethical unless you are a gaming journalist #GamerGate                            1           17-Oct

@a_man_in_black #GamerGate is not about harassment of any gender or sexuality or race. As much as anti wish it were true.                           1           17-Oct
@Hermetic Disagree, because the same rhetorical device applied to #GamerGate will just be applied to whatever spinoff.                  1                   17-Oct
@Timpossible_21 My reaction was that both sides do wrong things. Accusing only #GamerGate of harassment is telling half of the truth.                   1                   17-Oct

#Gamergate thinks Rev60 is rape because you control a female, then they also like raping men since most game characters are men.                        1               17-Oct
If you asked me, #GamerGate's vitriol should be more about general laziness and indifference towards the audience in gaming journalism.                         1           17-Oct

@BenKuchera Maybe MRAs can relate to #Gamergate b/c they know what it's like to be stereotyped as misogynists.                                  1   24-Oct

@chilblane can't help you if you can't understand something as simple as enabling individual trolls by blaming all of #GamerGate.                   1       1           24-Oct
Fuck #GamerGate cowards. Anyone who targets someone for their race, gender or sexuality is in need of a serious, serious education.     1                               24-Oct

@GenGreg_ @Nightlark_Lunis I think that how they've handled #GamerGate is a big example of how unethical they are willing to go, or are.                            1           24-Oct
